      What is Solar Power?
    </h2>
    <p>Solar Power is a renewable source of energy retrieved from the sun. The EIA (or the US’ Energy Information Administration) “defines solar energy as the sun's rays that reach the Earth which can then be converted into a form of energy, like heat and
      electricity”. Around the world, solar power is a better and more efficient way to generate energy.</p>

    <h2 class="info">How much does it Cost?
    </h2>
    <p>Over the past six years, the cost of solar energy has dropped dramatically, to the point where it is now even cheaper than wind power in emerging markets like China and India. This may be largely due to rising investments in solar over the last few
      years. Now, there is electricity being produced in Chile for $29.10 per megawatt hour–half the price of power produced by coal."Renewables are robustly entering the era of undercutting" energy made by fossil fuels, Bloomberg New Energy Finance chairman
      Michael Liebreich wrote this week.This is great news for developing nations, which do not generally have the kind of infrastructure that developed countries have to fossil fuels already in place. As they build their energy infrastructure, it will
      make sense to go with cheaper, renewable options, more so than it does for a country like the United States to abandon our formidable fossil-fuel based infrastructure.</p>
